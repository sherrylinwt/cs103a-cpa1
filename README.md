This is the data analysis assignment CPA01 for CS103a. 
In this assignment, I analyzed a dataset describing COVID-19 world vaccination progress from 12/02/2020 to 03/06/2022. In particular, I looked at the three most populated countries in North America (USA, Canada, Mexico) and compared their daily vaccinated population and the trend of the amount of people being fully vaccinated.
